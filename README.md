## About
This project scrapes the data of [United States Popeyes Locations](https://locations.popeyes.com/index.html) per city and compiles it into a csv file. The code accounts for the most common errors and typos that plague the original source.

### CSV Fields:
* **Location:** Cities with at least one Popeyes restaurant, in "City, State" format.
* **Count:** The number of Popeyes restaurants in a given city.
